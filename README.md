				REACT

Welcome to ALX React where i will cover the in-depth functionalities using react.React is a tool for building UI components.


	How does React Work?
  1.React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

  2.React only changes what needs to be changed!

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed..



	Getting Started 
To use React in production, you need npm which is included with Node.js.
To get an overview of what React is, you can write React code directly in HTML.
But in order to use React in production, you need npm and Node.js installed.


	Setting up a React Environment
If you have npx and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by using create-react-app.f you've previously installed create-react-app globally, it is recommended that you uninstall the package to ensure npx always uses the latest version of create-react-app.
To uninstall, run this command: npm uninstall -g create-react-app.
Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:
	npx create-react-app my-react-app
The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application..
