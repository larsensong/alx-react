0. Read data from a JSON
Reuse the latest dashboard project you worked on in the React course 0x06-React_state

For this task, place notifications.json into the root of the project directory and use the data inside for the next step.

Create a new notifications.js file in a schema folder:

Import the JSON data from notifications.json and give it a name. Try import * as [variable name] from [path to notifications.json]
Create a function named getAllNotificationsByUser that accepts userId as an argument
The function should return a list containing all the context objects from the notifications.json data when the author id is the same as the userId

Create a notification entity in a variable called notification whose key is notifications and set the definition of the entity as so:
author: user
context: message
Add a test in schema/notifications.test.js to verify that your normalized data has a correct result array. It should contain:
